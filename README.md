# JAVA

Unfortunately, I have no plenty of my own code yet.
And all of classwork and practice task's content is protected by author rights (c). So, I hope, I'll be able to show my best just on your project :)  

```java        
        public class Hello{
            public static void main(String [] args){
                int x = 1;
                int y = 2;
                int result = x+y;
                System.out.print("Hello world!");
                System.out.print("Result - " + result);
            }
        }
```
